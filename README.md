# Metasploit-windows-GUI
A GUI for Metasploit that interacts with Metasploit-Windows without any form of RPC, this is done through window manipulation.

## Getting started
Get the latest [release](https://github.com/kres0345/Metasploit-windows-GUI/releases).
If you don't know which to download(`x64` or `x86`), then you probably ain't in the right place. 
I suggest you take a short break from whatever you are doing and maybe read [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing) [of](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/32-bit-vs-64-bit-operating-systems/) [these](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq) [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64).

## How to use
Pretty straight ahead.


### Dev Note

If I get the time, and am in the mood for it â€” then I might clean up this project.  Some of the things that need cleaning is:

- Remove buttons or add feature for the button in question
- Make installation dialogue optional instead of main window
- Function and variable refactoring if the item in question might need it
- More detailed README
- My Room
